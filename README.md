# esphome_gy601
Esphome example for the uart based GY-601 optical temperature sensor.

I created this as I could not find an example anywhere.  I used other UART and sensor examples to form the esphome basics...  The implementation to read the GY-601 is very basic, and my own derivatives.  IT works reliably

# Installation

1. Copy the GY-601.h file to your config/esphome folder. You can do this in many ways. SAMBA share being one method.
2. Create a new entitiy in ESP home, and modify/replace the yaml file with the example fireplace_temp.yaml from this repo.
3. Modify the neccesary sections to match your environment.

Enjoy.
